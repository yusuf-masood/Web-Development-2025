            // There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

            // Seven primitive data types:
                // number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
                // bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
                // string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
                // boolean for true/false.
                // null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
                // undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
                // symbol for unique identifiers.
                
            // And one non-primitive data type:
                // object for more complex data structures.
